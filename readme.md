## How to Run Locally 

1. **Start the Streamlit app**  
   In your terminal, run:
   ```
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

2. **Open in your browser**  
   The app will launch automatically. If not, visit [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).

## Data Processing & Modeling

- Data is cleaned, encoded, and scaled before modeling.
- Linear Regression is used for price prediction (can be replaced with other models).
- Input validation and error messages are included for user-friendly experience.
- Model performance dashboard displays key metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ²) and visualizations (predicted vs actual, residuals histogram).
- Confidence intervals are provided for real-time predictions in the predictor form.
- Tables for sample records, info, and describe are displayed at full width for better readability.
